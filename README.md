# Zoomerok - fair video platform

Are you Zoomer? OK, it doesn't matter. Everyone deserves fair platform for their content.

The platform was created by content creators who have been interfered with by large corporations and have been removed from major social networks. After the removal, the authors lost all their many years of work: photos, videos, articles and fan base. Just at the snap of the fingers. Without possibility to recover any piece of data.

The idea of creating a project where only content creators will own their content and their fan base has been in the air for many years.

Right now, the world is changing and fair finance ([Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/)), an fair data registry (Ethereum, [xDai](https://www.xdaichain.com/)) and a fair data storage ([SWARM](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee), [FairOS](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairOS-dfs)) are becoming available to all people in the world.

Based on these technologies, a mobile application was created with one of the most trending types of content - short videos. Anyone in the world can become a content producer on our test* platform.

## How does the project work?

The mobile app is built on top of [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and supports Android and iOS mobile platforms.

[FairOS](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairOS-dfs) is used as an authentication and data management system, which operates on the basis of the [SWARM](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee) decentralized data storage system.

For reliable access to your account and fan base, a Web3 sign-on solution [GetLogin](https://github.com/GetLoginEth/login) is being developed and planned for implementation.

A distinctive feature of the project is that all your content can be accessed from applications that support the FairOS API. For example, [Fairdrive](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairdrive-theapp). You always have a choice with which tool you will create/consume content.

To access your data, the application contacts the servers, which have access to all the latest updates from users of the decentralized system. If you do not want a third-party server to see which resources you are accessing and from which IP address, then you can always independently launch the local version of the server and connect it to the mobile application. This will keep the network truly decentralized.
